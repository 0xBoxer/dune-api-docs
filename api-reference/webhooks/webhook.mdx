You can send Dune data to a webhook by going to any query and pressing the "schedule" button to the left of "Run" in the editor. You'll see a popup like the one below, where you can paste in any webhook url and recieve data on a scheduled interval.

<Frame className="tailwind styles object-scale-down">

</Frame>

The schema of the webhook data should reflect the following format when sent. 

```json
{
	message: string,
	query_result: {
	  execution_id: string;
	  query_id: number;
	  state: string;
	  submitted_at: string;
	  expires_at: string;
	  execution_started_at: string;
	  execution_ended_at: string;
	  result: {
	    data_uri: string;
	    metadata: {
	      column_names: string[];
	      result_set_bytes: number;
	      total_row_count: number;
	      datapoint_count: number;
	      pending_time_millis: number;
	      execution_time_millis: number;
	    };
	  };
	}
}
```

You can quickly test the output with a webhook generator [like this one](https://webhook.site/#!/).

<Note>
You'll need to then GET query the `data_uri` with your api key in the header to get the results of the query.

Here is an example response from this [Jupiter swap fees query](https://dune.com/queries/3106864):
