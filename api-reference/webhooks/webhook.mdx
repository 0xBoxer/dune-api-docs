You can send Dune data to a webhook by going to any query and pressing the "schedule" button to the left of "Run" in the editor. You'll see a popup like the one below, where you can paste in any webhook url and recieve data on a scheduled interval.

The schema of the webhook data should reflect the following format when sent:

```json
{
	message: string,
	query_result: {
	  execution_id: string;
	  query_id: number;
	  state: string;
	  submitted_at: string;
	  expires_at: string;
	  execution_started_at: string;
	  execution_ended_at: string;
	  result: {
	    data_uri: string;
	    metadata: {
	      column_names: string[];
	      result_set_bytes: number;
	      total_row_count: number;
	      datapoint_count: number;
	      pending_time_millis: number;
	      execution_time_millis: number;
	    };
	  };
	}
}
```

You can quickly validate the format with a webhook generator [like this one](https://webhook.site/#!/).
