title: 'CRUD Repo Setup'
---

In this quickstart, we will walk through how to turn any dashboard (or set of queries) into a GitHub repository that uses our CRUD API.

### Prerequisites
- Python environment set up (check out [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.continuum.io/free/navigator/) if you want somewhere to start.)
- Have a Dune API key from the team/user who's queries you want to manage (to obtain one [follow the steps here](../overview/authentication#generate-an-api-key)

### Set up a new repo from the GitHub template 

Use [this GitHub template](https://github.com/duneanalytics/DuneQueryRepo) to create your own repository, then follow these steps:

1. Generate an API key from your Dune account and put that in both your `.env` file and [github action secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) (name it `DUNE_API_KEY`). You can create a key under your Dune team settings. Add `https://api.dune.com/api` into the action secrets under `DUNE_API_BASE_URL` too. *The api key must be from a plus plan for this repo to work.*

2. Then, go to the dashboard you want to create a repo for (must be owned by you/your team). Click on the "github" button in the top right of your dashboard to see the query ids.

3. Copy and paste that list into the `queries.yml` file inside the `/queries` folder. You can paste any list of query ids, doesn't have to be linked to a dashboard.

4. Then, run `pull_from_dune.py` to bring in all queries into `/query_{id}.sql` files within the `/queries` folder. Directions to setup and run this script are below.

5. Make any changes you need to directly in the repo. Any time you push a commit to MAIN branch, `push_to_dune.py` will save your changes into Dune directly.

<Tip> 
You can press the "github" button on your own dashboard to get a list of query ids, or you can just paste in any query ids yourself. The query id comes from the url, `dune.com/queries/<query_id>/<visualization_id>`.
</Tip>

Anytime you commit a change to the repo, it will now update your queries in the app too. You can run `pull_from_dune.py` anytime to update the repo with any changes from the app.
