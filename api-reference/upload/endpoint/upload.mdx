<Accordion title="Upload Tips">
For working with uploads, keep in mind that:
- File has to be < 200 MB
- Column names in the table can't start with a special character or digits.
- Private uploads require a Premium subscription.
- If you upload to an existing table name, it will delete the old data and overwite it with your new data. There is no append feature at the moment.
- To delete an upload table, you must go to the `Dune UI -> user settings -> uploads` and then delete it.
