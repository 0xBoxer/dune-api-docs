<Tip>
For working with uploads, keep in mind that:
- File has to be < 200 MB
- Column names in the table can't start with a special character or digits.
- Private uploads require a Premium subscription.
- If you upload to an existing table name, it will delete the old data and overwite it with your new data. There is no append feature at the moment.
- To delete an upload table, you must go to the `dune.com -> user settings (top of page) -> data -> delete` and then delete it.
