title: 'Get Execution Result'
openapi: 'GET /v1/execution/{execution_id}/results'
---

You must pass the `execution_id` obtained from making an [execute query](execute-query) POST request. 

Result returns the status, metadata, and query results (in JSON) from a query execution.


<Info> Results data from an execution are currently stored for 2 years. We may reduce this to something closer to 90 days in the future. This is visible on the API response on the “expires_at” field in the execution status and results body. </Info>

<Info> There is currently a 1GB limit in how much data a single API result call can return, but there is a chance we reduce this overall or based on varying paid plan types. </Info>

<Accordion title="Execute query and get result in one call">
  <Tip> If you are using the [Python SDK](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/tree/d2195b2a9577e2dcae5d2600cb3eddce20987f38), you can directly executes and fetches result in one function call, like below: </Tip>

    ``` python Python SDK 

    import dotenv, os, json
    from dune_client.types import QueryParameter
    from dune_client.client import DuneClient
    from dune_client.query import QueryBase

    # change the current working directory where .env file lives
    os.chdir("/Users/abc/local-Workspace/python-notebook-examples")
    # load .env file
    dotenv.load_dotenv(".env")
    # setup Dune Python client
    dune = DuneClient.from_env()

    ```
    Use `run_query` to get result in JSON, 
        `run_query_csv` to get result in CSV format, 
        and `run_query_dataframe` to get result in Pandas dataframe
    ```

    result = dune.run_query(
        query=query # pass in query to run 
        , performance = 'large' # optionally define which tier to run the execution on (default is "medium")
        )

    ```
