title: Execution ID
---

An execution ID is generated when you initiate the execution of a query through the [execute query](../query-api//endpoint/execute-query) endpoint.

Unlike a query ID, which identifies a specific query, an execution ID represents a particular execution of that query.

With an execution ID, you can monitor the execution's status using the [check status](../query-api//endpoint/get-execution-status) endpoint. The status can be one of the following: pending, success, or failure.

If an execution is successful, you can also retrieve its latest result (provided it hasn't expired).

<Tip>
    Consider saving your execution ID in some cases to retrieve the result later without initiating a new execution.
