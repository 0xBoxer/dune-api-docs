title: Execution ID
---

An execution ID is generated when you initiate the execution of a query through the [execute query](../query-api//endpoint/execute-query) endpoint.

Unlike a query ID, which identifies a specific query, an execution ID represents a particular execution of that query.

With an execution ID, you can monitor the execution's status using the [check status](../query-api//endpoint/get-execution-status) endpoint. The status can be one of the following: pending, success, or failure.

If an execution is successful, you can get the result using [get result](../query-api/endpoint/get-execution-result). Results are saved and can be retrieved multiple times.
Results data from an execution are stored with an expiration date of 90 days (subject to change). This is visible on the API response on the “expires_at” field in the execution status and results json body (not on the CSV endpoint).

<Tip>
    Consider saving your execution ID in some cases to retrieve the result later without initiating a new execution.
