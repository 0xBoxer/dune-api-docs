#### How many Requests Per Minute can I make?

The API rate limit currently varies by [subscription plan](https://dune.com/pricing). This is an overall rate limit for any type of API call made. 

#### Are there specified SLAs?

SLAs are only available on Enterprise pricing plans.

#### How do I find a query id?

When navigating to a query, it’s the first number after “/queries/” in the URL. For example in `https://dune.com/queries/241/388`, "241" is the query id.

#### Does the API support Query Parameters?

Yes, check out [this page](/api-reference/overview/query-parameters).

#### What are the performance and overall differences between the Dune API and the Dune web app? What are the differences in what I can query?

There are no major performance differences within a specific performance tier when used through the Dune API or Dune web app.

The Dune API gives you programmatic access to the capabilities and data sets that can already be accessed from the Dune web app.

#### What is the execution timeout limit and can I request a longer limit?

The query execution timeout limit matches the Dune web app - 30 minutes. You can't request a longer limit.

#### What is the difference between the states “Executing” and “Pending”?

Pending means, the execution is waiting for an available execution connection slot.

Executing means the query is currently executing against the database.

#### Can I ingest data by getting a direct connection to the database instead?
    
Not currently. 

#### Are query results data saved for faster retrieval?
    
Yes!

#### How long are the results data from an execution stored for?
    
The results storage period can be found on the API response on the “expires_at” field in the execution status and results body.

#### How much data can I retrieve in a single API result call?
    
There is currently a ~1GB limit. The API does not currently return an explicit error upon hitting this limit but will instead fail (timeout) when attempting to retrieve the results.
