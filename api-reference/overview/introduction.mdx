## Jackie and Andrew's TODOs

- Authentication
  - Generate an API key
  - Keeping API key safe
  - Context of key (can only access team resources, and not user resources especially for crud)
  - Authentication & making API calls
- Setting up Python client
- Query parameters explained
- Execution ID explained
- Rate limits (and other limits like result size and storage limits)
- Troubleshooting common errors
