**Rate Limits**

Our rate limits are implemented in three ways: IP, low vs. high limit endpoints and [subscription plan](https://dune.com/pricing).
- Low limit endpoints _(write-heavy operations)_
    - [create query](../crud/endpoint/create), [update query](../crud/endpoint/create), toggle private/archive query, [execute query](../query-api/endpoint/execute-query), [CSV upload](../upload/endpoint/upload). 
- High limit endpoints _(read-heavy operations)_
    - [read query](../crud/endpoint/read), read result (in any form), [get execution status](../query-api/endpoint/get-execution-status), [cancel execution](../query-api/endpoint/cancel-execution).

| Dimension         |    | Limit                              |
|-------------------|----|------------------------------------|
| Per IP            |    | 1000 requests per second (rps)     |
| Free  | Low limit | 15 requests per minute (rpm) |
| Free  | High limit | 40 rpm |
| Plus       | Low limit | 70 rpm |
| Plus       | High limit | 200 rpm |
| Premium    | Low limit | 350 rpm |
| Premium    | High limit | 1000 rpm |
| Enterprise |            | Please contact us!


<Note>
Rate limits for different dimensions are separate but can be utilized independently. 
For example, on the Free plan, you have a low limit of 15 requests per minute and a high limit of 40 requests per minute. You can use both types of requests in the same minute, effectively having a combined limit of 55.

**Data Return Limit**

Dune imposes a 1GB data limit on query results for each query logic execution. If your query logic yields more than 1GB of data, the result will be truncated in storage. In such cases, pulling the result data with `allow_partial_results` set to false (the default) will trigger an error message: "error": "Partial Result, please request with 'allows_partial_results=true'". To retrieve partial results, you must pass the parameter `allow_partial_results=true`.
