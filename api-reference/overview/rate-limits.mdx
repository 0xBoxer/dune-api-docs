**Data Return Limit**

Currently, each API result call is limited to returning a maximum of 1GB of data. 

_Future improvement incoming_

_Once we implement pagination, we plan to increase this data return limit._

**Rate Limits Implementation**

Our rate limits are implemented in three ways: IP, low vs. high limit endpoints and [subscription plan](https://dune.com/pricing).
- Low limit endpoints _(write-heavy operations)_
    - [create query](../crud/endpoint/create), [update query](../crud/endpoint/create), toggle private/archive query, [execute query](../query-api/endpoint/execute-query), [CSV upload](../upload/endpoint/upload). 
- High limit endpoints _(read-heavy operations)_
    - [read query](../crud/endpoint/read), read result (in any form), [get execution status](../query-api/endpoint/get-execution-status), [cancel execution](../query-api/endpoint/cancel-execution).
